# Gitcoin Passport

It is an initiative launched in collaboration with Gitcoin and Ceramic Network that aims to solve the digital decentralized identity verification problem.

Gitcoin passport is an identity aggregator that combines the top identity providers from the web 2.0 and web 3.0 worlds into a single, transportable identity that proves one's identity. Once the user has verified their identity with various trusted third parties, the passport will issue a "Stamp" or verifiable credential (VC), which is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable and can later be used to calculate a personhood score.

A centralized system makes it very easy for hackers to access user identity data and privacy. Decentralized identity solutions provide a new way of managing your identity and personal data by giving you more control over it.

## Who are the users of Gitcoin Passport?

Creating a unique digital identity will allow you to access online resources and participate in online communities more easily.

<ul>
<li><b>Innovators: </b>Users who are building blockchain applications will need a way to securely and easily build their identity across multiple chains and DApps.</li>
<li><b>Guilds: </b>Guilds might need a way to form a community of legitimate users and protect their resources from sybil attack.</li>
<li><b>Communities: </b>They can gain trust that consumer information shared with them is accurate and pertains to the person they are transacting with, thus decreasing fraud.</li>
</ul>

## How does decentralized identity work?

Gitcoin passport allows users to verify their identity by linking their identities with other providers. The linked identities are then signed and issued a stamp or identity attestation. These stamps are stored on a ceramic network and are used as verifiable credentials in the form of JSON data that is publicly visible and can be queried by anyone looking to verify identity or claim ownership.

You can use Gitcoin Passport SDK Reader in your DApp to verify the credentials of the user. Ref: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gitcoinco/passport-sdk-reader

Learn how to use the SDK by following this <a href='/docs/basics/how-to-use-sdk'>tutorial</a>.
