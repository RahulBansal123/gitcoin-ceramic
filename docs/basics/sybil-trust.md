# Sybil Attacks & Trust Score

### What is Gitcoin quadratic funding?

Gitcoin uses a mechanism called "Quadratic funding" to fund public goods. QF allocates funds based on how much each participant contributes to each project. This creates more democracy in funding decisions, which is better for all involved.

### Sybil attack in Gitcoin funding

For secoquadraticndary funds, the number of donations is more important than the total donations. That is, instead of funding a project for $ 1000, users create multiple wallets, split this amount into multiple wallets, and donate to that project. This allows the project to get a large share of the Quadratic funding pool, which is unfair.

### What is trust bonus?

Gitcoin verifiers the user's decentralized identity and then awards them a trust bonus for having a verified identity. This bonus helps to weigh their contribution more fairly in the system.
