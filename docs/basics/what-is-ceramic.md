# What is ceramic

Ceramic is a decentralized network for composable data.

Building applications with composable Web3 data is easy with a marketplace of data models. You simply plug the models into your app, store, update, and retrieve data from them. When different applications use the same data models, their data is automatically interoperable. By decentralizing application databases, Ceramic makes data composable and reusable across all applications.
