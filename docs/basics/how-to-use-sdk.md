# Creating Passport

Visit the Gitcoin Passport app at: https://passport.gitcoin.co/

<b>Remember:</b> Your passport is associated with your Ethereum address, so be sure to use a wallet address that you will use when presenting your passport.
<br/>
<br/>

Once connected, you'll have access to a variety of stamps to collect that you can use as entries in your passport.

If you're new to using the Passport app, Gitcoin will create a new passport for you on Ceramic. If you are a returning user, your passport information should load from the Ceramic Network and you will be able to see your previously saved stamps.

3. Now you can get all the stamps available and once connected, the Verifiable Credential will be saved into your passport, and it will be available to any 3rd party app where you present your passport.

4. If you collect multiple stamps, your trust score goes up, and some DApps might restrict access to their DApps based on the trust score.
